      <h2>At-Home Teeth Whitening</h2>
      <p>
        At-home teeth whitening is a convenient way to achieve your desired
        whiteness in the comfort of your own home. Our clinic follows these
        steps to ensure that the whitening process is both effective and safe:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Impression Taking and Custom Tray Preparation</h3>
      <p>
        As the first step, our dentist thoroughly examines your teeth and oral
        cavity, then takes an impression of your teeth. This impression is used
        to create a precisely fitting, custom whitening tray that ensures
        optimal contact between the whitening agent and your teeth.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Tray Preparation</h3>
      <p>
        Based on the impression, we create a custom whitening tray that fits
        your teeth perfectly. This personalized tray ensures the even and
        effective distribution of the whitening gel over the surface of your
        teeth.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Whitening Agent and Usage Instructions</h3>
      <p>
        Once the tray is ready, our dentist provides you with the whitening
        agent and detailed instructions for use. We demonstrate how to apply the
        whitening gel to the trays and how to wear them correctly. It is
        important to follow the instructions precisely to achieve the best
        results.
      </p>

      <h3>4. At-Home Use</h3>
      <p>
        During at-home whitening, apply the whitening gel to the inside of the
        trays, then insert the trays over your teeth for the recommended
        duration. Throughout the treatment, you can regularly check the color
        changes in your teeth and consult your dentist as needed to optimize the
        results.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Aftercare and Maintaining Results</h3>
      <p>
        After the treatment, our dentist provides advice on how to maintain the
        whiteness of your teeth and how to care for them to prevent further
        decay and discoloration. Proper aftercare helps preserve the whitening
        results in the long term.
      </p>
